# Example config file for future reference
# Cluster node

hostname: master-1

cluster:
    # only one master per cluster
    # this would be set for the node you want to set up first, and then the rest of the nodes would join this one
    master: true
    # control-plane or worker, adds a role label to the node if control-plane is true
    # you can add additional roles later after the cluster is set up
    role: master
    # Make this node a part of the k8s database cluster
    # if kine is enabled, this is ignored and the node will use an external database
    run-db: true
    # Parameters for joining the cluster
    # if master is false, required to join cluster, if not, you only need to set token
    join:
        endpoint: "https://master-1:6443" # or whatever the master's endpoint is
        token: abcdef.1234567890abcdef # [6 alphanumeric].[16 alphanumeric]
        ca-cert-hash: "" # hash of the CA cert

# SSH keys should be in ignition config

# Networking setup
networking:
    internal-ip: null # null or "", if you want to automatically get the IP address
    external-ip: null # null or "" if you want to set none
    cni: flannel # flannel, cilium, canal, calico
    pod-cidr: 10.42.0.0/16
    service-cidr: # idk
    cni-values:
        # whatever here to pass to the CNI, else defaults are used in values.yaml
        foo: bar

# Database setup
database:
    # etcd stuff

    kine: # use kine instead of etcd

        datastore: postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname

    # You can add extra etcd config as a configmap or secret, since someone would be backing up
    # their snapshots off-cluster anyway
